# Docker
Docker is a platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers bundle an application and all its dependencies (such as libraries, binaries, and configuration files) together, ensuring consistency across various environments.

## Key Concepts of Docker
     - Containers: Containers are isolated environments that run applications. They are lightweight and use the host system's kernel, making them faster and more efficient than virtual machines.
     - Images: Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. An image could contain just an OS or a fully configured application. Images are built from a Dockerfile and can be stored in repositories like Docker Hub.
     - Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of commands that define what an image should include and how it should be configured. It is used to build Docker images.
     - Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry where Docker users can store and share Docker images.
     - Docker Engine: The core component that creates, manages, and runs Docker containers.

## Benefits of Using Docker
* Consistency Across Environments: Docker eliminates the "works on my machine" problem by creating a consistent environment from development to production.
* Isolation: Containers run in isolated environments, ensuring that applications don't interfere with each other.
* Scalability: Docker makes it easier to scale applications up or down using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
* Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications across environments.
* Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and use fewer resources than virtual machines, leading to improved performance and faster startup times.

## Common Docker Commands
  - docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
  - docker pull: Download an image from a registry.
  - docker run: Create and run a container from an image.
  - docker ps: List running containers.
  - docker stop: Stop a running container.
  - docker rm: Remove a stopped container.
  - docker rmi: Remove an image.

## Example Use Case
Docker is widely used in various scenarios, such as:
* Microservices Architecture
* Development Environments
* CI/CD Pipelines

Docker is a powerful tool that helps developers build, ship, and run applications more efficiently.
